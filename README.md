# topclean
> Free up disk space with one command

## Motivation and Inspiration

`topclean` has been inspired by these projects:
- [BleachBit](https://github.com/bleachbit/bleachbit)
- [topgrade](https://github.com/r-darwish/topgrade)

The goal is to provide disk cleaning functionality like BleachBit, but in a zero/low config way like topgrade offers for software upgrades. Another similarity to the latter is a focus on development tools.

## Usage

`topclean` is intended to be executed when you are running low on disk space and you are sure that deleting temporary files, caches, files marked for deletion (e.g. recycle bin) etc. is safe.

Until builds are provided, you need to run `go run main.go`.
